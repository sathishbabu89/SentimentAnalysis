Sure! Here’s the content of each slide from the clean version of the presentation:

---

### 🎯 **Slide 1: The Voice of the Customer is Getting Lost in the Noise**

- Customer sentiment is fragmented — insights are buried in disparate systems and reviewed too late.  
- By the time we act, the damage to trust and NPS is already done.  
- No single view of customer emotion across journeys, channels, and regions.  
- Product teams are reactive, not insight-driven when fixing experience issues.  
- **“We monitor transactions in real-time — why not monitor emotions in real-time too?”**

### 🚀 **Slide 2: Real-Time Sentiment Intelligence — Built for Lloyds at Scale**

- Live ingestion from app reviews, social posts, support logs, and call transcripts.  
- AI-driven sentiment engine filters noise and flags what's truly negative.  
- Location-aware heatmaps surface regional patterns and pain points.  
- Automated alerts and escalations to product and operations teams — as it happens.  
- Trend analysis over time to prevent repeat issues.  
- Faster issue detection = Higher CSAT
